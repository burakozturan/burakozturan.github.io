I am a Ph.D. candidate in Network Science at Northeastern University, advised by [David Lazer](https://www.lazerlab.net/people/david-lazer), and my research focuses on emergent phenomena that arise from the complex interactions between humans and sociotechnical systems. Broadly situated at the intersection of political behavior, political communication, and social modeling, my work examines the structural features of digital information ecosystems and their implications for deliberation and inequality.

Currently completing my dissertation on concentration and segregation in online information ecosystems, examining how a small set of users and sources comes to dominate the information market, and how exposure to content becomes segregated across demographic and ideological groups. In Summer 2025, I have been studying the market for political news, with [David Rothschild](https://researchdmr.com/) to understand how much political news is consumed and where people encounter it on their mobile devices.

Extending this agenda, my current work examines the evolving interactions between humans and large language models, investigating how these interactions are transforming access to and exposure to information. From a technological perspective, I am interested in  how interactions with LLM agents structure the diversity and the quality of information;  from the human side, I explore how these systems influence what people see, trust.

If you're interested in any of this, I'd be happy to chat just drop me a message or let's grab coffee!
