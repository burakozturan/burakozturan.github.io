I am a Ph.D. candidate in Network Science at Northeastern University, advised by [David Lazer](https://www.lazerlab.net/people/david-lazer), and a 2025 research intern at Microsoft Research working with [David Rothschild](https://researchdmr.com/).

My  research focuses on developing concepts and metrics to rigorously measure and describe the structure of online information ecosystems. I study these ecosystems through the lens of complex systems, examining how the interaction between individual preferences and technological systems gives rise to broader structural patterns. Specifically, I conduct cross-platform analyses of market concentration in the information landscape and investigate how patterns of segregation of information consumption evolve over time, contributing to the literature on the online echo chambers.

During Summer 2025, I have been studying the evolving market for news—analyzing how major media outlets establish their presence across digital platforms, and identifying and characterizing the various mediums through which people access news, both directly (such as visiting homepages) and indirectly (such as through social media referrals or algorithmic feeds). 

If you're interested in any of this, I'd be happy to chat—just drop me a message or let's grab coffee!
