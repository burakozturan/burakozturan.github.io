I study how humans navigate complex digital environments. My research applies network science and computational methods to large-scale behavioral trace data, examining the emergent properties of human-technology interactions.

I was a research intern with the Computational Social Science team at Microsoft Research NYC in summer 2025. Prior to Northeastern, I completed an M.Sc. in Social and Economic Data Science at the University of Konstanz. Please see my publications and ongoing projects in the respective tabs above, and feel free to reach out if anything seems of interest.
